# Contributing

If you believe a feature is missing, or have an idea for how to improve the API, then by all means contribute! Make sure
to follow clean-code styles. I closely follow the principles set forth by books such as _Effective Java_ by Joshua Bloch,
_Clean Code_, and _The Clean Coder_ by Robert Cecil Martin.

Some good general guidelines to keep in mind:

- Make sure your implementation closely matches the implementation you see present in the source files (same code style)
- Make sure to add Javadoc to every member, field, class, method, etc.
- Make sure to write unit tests if applicable for your added code up update any tests which might be failing due to a
  change you made
- Make sure all unit tests are passing before you submit a PR
- Make sure that code coverage is maintained at 100% before you submit a PR

## Issues

Don't worry about following a specific issue format, just check that your issue doesn't already exist before creating it. If you're submitting a PR to fix something, make sure there's an issue to reference (create one if needed and assign it to yourself).
